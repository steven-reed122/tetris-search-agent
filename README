Playing Tetris using a Search Algorithm Agent

To run this program, run the main file and follow the prompts.
A pygame pop up with the game running should appear after all prompts are answered.
Make sure to download the pygame library before running.
If the game is running in user input mode, use the arrow codes to input moves.
If the game is running AI input mode, it should run on its own once the pygame window opens.

All code regarding the AI is in the AI.py and small_tetris.py files.
